# Solutions

This repository will store my solutions to problems from coding challenge websites like Exercism, Leetcode, and Advent of Code.

## Getting Started

The validation process has not been automated because I prefer to just write the code in my editor and check the answers manually.

To get started:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/kaiyanlee/solutions

# Enter one of the directories and run the code...

# Exercism is different because you need the command-line client to generate test files
# and download the questions...
```
